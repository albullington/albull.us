    <BodyText>In my marketing days, I influenced designers, engineers, product managers, legal teams, and content writers to create campaigns with an eye towards the end user.</BodyText>
    <BodyText>I'm fluent in Mandarin, and I've used my language skills to bridge cultural barriers while advising startups in China and Taiwan, translating movie scripts from Chinese into English, and spinning up the English text for mobile apps in Hong Kong.</BodyText>
    <BodyText>Finally, I'm trained in non-violent communication. I participated in Stanford's intensive T-Group session to better understand the impact of my words on others, and I host regular non-violent communication practice sessions.</BodyText>
