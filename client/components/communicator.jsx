    <BodyText>I'm <BodyLink href="http://www.neeslanguageblog.com/2014/07/interview-amanda-bullington-united.html">fluent in Mandarin.</BodyLink>I've used my language skills to bridge cultural barriers while advising Taiwanese and Chinese startups, translating movie scripts from Chinese into English, and spinning up text for mobile games in Hong Kong.</BodyText>
    <BodyText>Finally, I'm a <BodyLink href="https://baynvc.org/">non-violent communicator.</BodyLink>I participated in Stanford's intensive T-Group session to better understand the impact of my words on others, and I host regular non-violent communication practice sessions.</BodyText>
